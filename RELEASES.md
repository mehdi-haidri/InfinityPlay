# Release Notes

## 0.3.2 (Latest update)

### Audio language control

- English is now the default and universal fallback, followed by Arabic and French.
- Removed Hindi and other unsupported dubbed variants from catalog results and audio pickers.
- Android Media3 now receives real language tags (`en`, `ar`, `fr`) and selects the preferred supported track instead of the first manifest track.
- Applied the same supported-language filtering to HLS and DASH playback on desktop.

### Linux media tools

- Linux now uses the maintained `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` installed by the distribution instead of bundled static executables.
- Restored dedicated FFprobe codec and duration inspection.
- DEB, RPM, and Arch packages declare FFmpeg as a dependency; AppImage users install it once on the host.

### About and updates

- Fixed developer names, email addresses, GitHub handles, and build metadata overflowing narrow mobile screens.
- The in-app changelog now shows only the main updates for the running or incoming latest version, without the historical release archive.
- Kept the user-controlled download, pause, resume, cancel, and install-later update flow.

### Mobile experience

- Preserved the adaptive phone, tablet, and Android TV interface, native Media3 playback, Picture-in-Picture, quality controls, subtitles, and D-pad support.
